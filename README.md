# 📖 epub-parser

> A powerful yet easy-to-use epub parser

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40gxl%2Fepub-parser.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40gxl%2Fepub-parser)
![Test](https://github.com/gaoxiaoliangz/epub-parser/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

The package exports a simple parser function which use epub file as input and output JavaScript object.

As it is written in TypeScript, types are already included in the package.

## Install

```bash
npm install @gxl/epub-parser --save
```

or if you prefer yarn

```bash
yarn add @gxl/epub-parser
```

## Usage

```js
import { parseEpub } from '@gxl/epub-parser'

const epubObj = parseEpub('/path/to/file.epub', {
  type: 'path',
})

console.log('epub content:', epubObj)
```

### parseEpub(target: string | buffer, options?: object): EpubObject

#### target

type: `string` or `buffer`

It can be the path to the file or file's binary string or buffer

#### options

type: `object`

##### type(optional): 'binaryString' | 'path' | 'buffer'

It forces the parser to treat supplied target as the defined type, if not defined the parser itself will decide how to treat the file (useful when you are not sure if the path is valid).

#### EpubObject

The output is an object which contains `structure`, `sections`, `info`(private property names start with `_`. I don't recommend using them, since they are subscribed to change).

`structure` is the parsed `toc` of epub file, they contain information about how the book is constructed.

`sections` is an array of chapters or sections under chapters, they are referred in `structure`. Each section object contains the raw html string and a few handy methods.

- `Section.prototype.toMarkdown`: convert to markdown object.
- `Section.prototype.toHtmlObjects`: convert to html object. And a note about `src` and `href`, the `src` and `href` in raw html stay untouched, but the `toHtmlObjects` method resolves `src` to base64 string, and alters `href` so that they make sense in the parsed epub. And the parsed `href` is something like `#{sectionId},{hash}`.
